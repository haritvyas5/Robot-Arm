# Robot-Arm
hands-on lab project that connects Arduino hardware with Onshape CAD assemblies using the Onshape REST API and Python to control a digital twin of a robot arm.


## What Students Will Learn
- Configure and authenticate with the **Onshape API**
- Retrieve and update **mate values** in an assembly
- Stream potentiometer sensor data from **Arduino** over serial
- Map **real-world inputs** to digital mate motions
- Drive **CAD assemblies interactively in real time**

## Repository Contents
- **Jupyter/Colab notebooks** with Python code
- **Arduino sketches** for sensor data streaming
